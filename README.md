# WG21 SG16 Unicode study group
SG16 is an ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG21 C++ study group tasked with improving Unicode and text processing support within the C++ standard.

If you would like to contribute to the discussion, please join us on [<img src="http://slack.com/favicon.ico" height="16"/>Slack](https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/sg16-unicode) at https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/sg16-unicode and subcribe to our mailing list at http://www.open-std.org/mailman/listinfo/unicode.
