<h1>SG16: Unicode direction</h1>

<p>The SG16 Unicode study group was officially formed at the 2018 WG21 meeting
in Jacksonville, Florida.  We have not yet had our inaugural meeting (that is
planned to be held during the upcoming meeting in San Diego), but we've had an
active group of WG21 members meeting via video conference regularly since
August of 2017, well before our formation as an official study group.
Summaries of these meetings are available at
<a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/blob/master/README.md">
https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings/blob/master/README.md</a>.
</p>

<p>Our proposals so far have focused on relatively small or foundational
features that have a realistic chance of being adopted for C++20.  These
include:

<p>This paper discusses a set of constraints, guidelines, directives, and
non-directives intended to guide our continuing efforts to improve Unicode
and text processing support in C++.  Paper authors intending to propose Unicode
or text processing related features are encouraged to consider the perspectives
and guidelines discussed here in their designs, or to submit papers arguing
against them.
</p>


<h1>Constraints: Accepting the things we cannot change</h1>

<p>C++ has a long history and, as unfortunate as it may be at times, the past
remains stubbornly immutable.  As we work to improve the future, we must remain
cognizant of the many billions of lines of C++ code in use today and how we will
enable past work to retain its value in the future.  The following limitations
reflect constraints on what we cannot affordably change, at least not in the
short term.
</p>


<h2>Constraint 1: The ordinary and wide execution encodings are implementation defined</h2>

<p>
<a title="Usage of UTF-8 for websites"
   href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/en-utf8/all/all">
UTF-8 has conquered the web</a>
<sup><a title="Usage of UTF-8 for websites"
        href="#ref_w3techs">
[W3Techs]</a></sup>,
but no such convergence has yet occurred for
the execution and wide execution character encodings.  Popular and commercially
significant platforms such as Windows and z/OS continue to support a wide array
of ASCII and EBCDIC based encodings for the execution character encoding as
required for compatibility by their long time customers.
</p>

<p>Might these platforms eventually move to UTF-8 or possibly cease to be
relevant for new C++ standards?
</p>

<p>Microsoft does not yet offer full support for UTF-8 as the execution
encoding for its compiler.  Support for a <tt>/utf-8</tt> compiler option was
added recently, but it does not affect the behavior of their standard library
implementation, nor is UTF-8 selectable as the execution encoding at run-time
via environment settings or by calling <tt>setlocale()</tt>.  Recent Windows
10 releases now support a beta option that allows setting the Windows system
code page to UTF-8 and this does affect the standard library (as well as all
other programs running on the system).  These additions indicate that it will
likely be <em>possible</em> to write native UTF-8 programs for Windows using
the Microsoft compiler in the not too distant future.  However, there will be
existing software written for Windows that will need to be migrated to new
C++ standards without incurring the cost of transition to UTF-8 for a long time
to come.
</p>

<p>IBM has not publicly released a C++11 compliant version of their xlC compiler
for z/OS.  However, they have publicly released support for
<a title="IBM Toolkit for Swift on z/OS"
   href="https://developer.ibm.com/mainframe/products/ibm-toolkit-swift-z-os/">
Swift on z/OS</a>
<sup><a title="IBM Toolkit for Swift on z/OS"
        href="#ref_swift_on_z">
[SwiftOnZ]</a></sup>, and
Swift is built on top of LLVM and Clang.  Though IBM has not publicly released
a port of Clang to z/OS, this indicates that such a port exists and
<a title="[swift-dev] z/OS, Swift, and encodings"
   href="https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-dev/Week-of-Mon-20170508/004572.html">
a post to the Swift developers mailing lists confirms it.</a>
<sup><a title="[swift-dev] z/OS, Swift, and encodings"
        href="#ref_clang_on_z">
[ClangOnZ]</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>The <tt>char16_t</tt> and <tt>char32_t</tt> encodings are currently
implementation defined as well.  However, all existing implementations use
UTF-16 and UTF-32 respectively for these encodings, thus their implementation
definedness is not a constraint.
<a title="Make char16_t/char32_t string literals be UTF-16/32"
   href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1041r1.html">
P1041R1</a>
<sup><a title="Make char16_t/char32_t string literals be UTF-16/32"
        href="#ref_p1041r1">
[P1041R1]</a></sup>
proposes officially standardizing UTF-16 and UTF-32 for these encodings.
</p>


<h2>Constraint 2: The ordinary and wide execution encodings are run-time properties</h2>

<p>The execution and wide execution encodings are not static properties of
programs, and therefore not fully known at compile-time.  These encodings
are determined at run-time and may be dynamically changed by calls to
<tt>setlocale()</tt>.  At compile-time, character and string literals are
transcoded (in translation phase 5) from the source encoding to an encoding
that is expected to be compatible with whatever encoding is selected at
run-time.  If the compile-time selected encoding turns out not to be
compatible with the run-time encoding, then encoding confusion (mojibake)
ensues.
</p>

<p>The dynamic nature of these encodings is not theoretical.  On Windows,
the execution encoding is determined at program startup based on the current
active code page.  On POSIX platforms, the run-time encoding is determined
by the <tt>LANG</tt>, <tt>LC_ALL</tt>, or <tt>LC_CTYPE</tt> environment
variables.  Some existing programs depend on the ability to dynamically change
(via POSIX <tt>uselocale()</tt> or Microsoft's <tt>_configthreadlocale()</tt>)
the execution encoding (within reason) in order for a server process to
concurrently serve multiple clients with different locale settings.  A recent
proposal to WG14 (N2226) proposes allowing the current locale settings to
vary by thread.  Attempting to restrict the ability to dynamically change
the execution encoding would break existing code.
</p>

<p>Since the <tt>char16_t</tt> and <tt>char32_t</tt> encodings are currently
implementation defined, they too could vary at run-time.  However, as noted
earlier, all implementations currently use UTF-16 and UTF-32 and do not support
such variance.
<a title="Make char16_t/char32_t string literals be UTF-16/32"
   href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1041r1.html">
P1041R1</a>
<sup><a title="Make char16_t/char32_t string literals be UTF-16/32"
        href="#ref_p1041r1">
[P1041R1]</a></sup>
will solidify current practice and ensure these encodings are known at
comple-time.
</p>


<h2>Constraint 3: There is no portable primary execution encoding</h2>

<p>On POSIX derived systems, the primary interface to the operating system is
via the ordinary character encoding.  This contrasts with Windows where the
primary interface is via the wide execution encoding and interfaces defined in
terms of <tt>char</tt> are implemented as wrappers around their wide
counterparts.  Unfortunately, such wrappers are often poor substitutes for use
of their wide cousins due to transcoding limitations; it is common that the
ordinary execution encoding is unable to represent all of the characters
supported by the wide execution encoding.
</p>

<p>The designers of the C++17 filesystem library had to wrestle with this
issue and addressed it via abstraction; <tt>std::filesystem::path</tt> has an
implementation defined <tt>value_type</tt> that reflects the primary operating
system encoding.  Member functions provide access to paths transcoded to any
one of the five standard mandated encodings (ordinary, wide, UTF-8,
<tt>char16_t</tt>, and <tt>char32_t</tt>).  This design serves as a useful
precedent for future design.
</p>


<h2>Constraint 4: <tt>wchar_t</tt> is a portability deadend</h2>

<p>The wide execution encoding was introduced to provide relief from the
constraints of the (typically 8-bit) <tt>char</tt> based ordinary execution
encodings by enabling a single large character set and trivial encoding that
avoided the need for multibyte encoding and ISO-2022 style character set
switching escape sequences.  Unfortunately, the size of <tt>wchar_t</tt>,
the character set, and its encoding were all left as implementation defined
properties resulting in significant implementation variance.  The present
situation is that the wide execution encoding is only widely used on
Windows where its implementation is actually non-conforming
<a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/9">
(https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues/9)</a>.
</p>


<h2>Constraint 5: <tt>char</tt> aliases everything</h2>

<p>Pointers to <tt>char</tt> may be used to inspect the underlying
representation of objects of any type with the consequence that lvalues of
type <tt>char</tt> alias with other types.  This restricts the ability of the
compiler to optimize code that uses <tt>char</tt>.  <tt>std::byte</tt> was
introduced in C++17 as an alternative type to use when <tt>char</tt>'s
aliasing abilities are desired, but it will be a long time, if ever, before
we can deprecate and remove <tt>char</tt>'s aliasing features.
</p>


<h2>Constraint 6: Implementors cannot afford to rewrite ICU</h2>

<p>ICU powers Unicode support in most portable C++ programs today due to its
long history, impressive feature set, and friendly license.  When considering
standardizing Unicode related reatures, we must keep in mind that the Unicode
standard is a large and complicated specification, and many C++ implementors
simply cannot afford to reimplement what ICU provides.  In practice this means
that we'll need to ensure that proposals for new Unicode features are
implementable using ICU.
</p>


<h1>Guidelines: Keep your eyes on the road, your hands upon the wheel</h1>

<p>Mistakes happen and will continue to happen.  Following a few common
guidelines will help to ensure we don't stray too far off course and help
to minimize mistakes.  The guidelines here are in no way specific to Unicode
or text processing, but represent areas where mistakes would be easy to make.
</p>


<h2>Guideline 1: Avoid excessive inventiveness; look for existing practice</h2>

<p>C++ has some catching up to do when it comes to Unicode support.  This means
that there is ample opportunity to investigate and learn from features added to
other languages.  A great example of following this guideline is found in the
<a title="Named character escapes"
   href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1097r1.html">
P1097R1</a>
<sup><a title="Named character escapes"
        href="#ref_p1097r1">
[P1097R1]</a></sup>
proposal to add named character escapes to character and string literals.
</p>


<h2>Guideline 2: Avoid gratuitous departure from C</h2>

<p>C and C++ continue to diverge and that is ok when there is good reason for
it (e.g., to enable better type safety and overloading).  However, gratuitous
departure creates unnecessary interoperability and software composition
challenges.  Where it makes sense, proposing features that are applicable for
C to WG14 will help to keep the common subset of the languages as large as it
can reasonably be.
<a title="Make char16_t/char32_t string literals be UTF-16/32"

and

P1097R1</a>
<sup><a title="Named character escapes"
        href="#ref_p1097r1">
[P1097R1]</a></sup>
are great examples of features that would be appropriate to propose for
inclusion in C.
</p>


<h1>Direction: Designing for where we want to be and how to get there</h1>

<p>Given the constraints above, how can we best integrate support for Unicode
following time honored traditions of C++ design including the zero overhead
principle, ensuring a transition path, and enabling software composition?  How
do we ensure a design that programmers will want to use?  The following
explores design considerations that SG16 participants have been discussing.
</p>

<p>The ordinary and wide execution encodings are not going away; they will
remain the bridge that text must cross when interfacing with the operating
system and with users.  Unless otherwise specified, I/O performed using
<tt>char</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt> based interfaces in portable programs must
abide by the encodings indicated by locale settings.  But internally, it is
desirable to work with a limited number of encodings (preferably only one)
that are known at compile time, and optimized for accordingly.  This suggests
a design in which transcoding is performed from dynamically determined external
encodings to a statically known internal encoding at program boundaries; when
reading files, standard input/output streams, command line options, environment
variables, etc...  This is standard practice today.
</p>

<p>There are two primary candidates for use as internal encodings today:
UTF-8 and UTF-16.  The former is commonly used on POSIX based platforms while
the latter remains the primary system encoding on Windows.  There is no
encoding that is the best internal encoding for all programs, nor necessarily
even for the same program on different platforms.  We face a choice here: do we
design for a single well known (though possibly implementation defined) internal
encoding?  Or do we continue the current practice of each program choosing its
own internal encoding(s)?  Active SG16 participants have not yet reached
consensus on these questions.
</p>

<p>Use of the type system to ensure that transcoding is properly performed
at program boundaries helps to prevent errors that lead to mojibake.
Such errors can be subtle and only manifest in relatively rare situations,
making them difficult to discover in testing.  For example, failure to
correctly transcode input from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 only results in negative
symptoms when the input contains characters outside the ASCII range.
</p>

<p>This is where the <tt>char8_t</tt> proposal
(<a title="char8_t: A type for UTF-8 characters and strings"
   href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0482r5.html">
P0482R5</a>
<sup><a title="char8_t: A type for UTF-8 characters and strings"
        href="#ref_p0482r5">
[P0482R5]</a></sup>)
comes in to play.
Having a distinct type for UTF-8 text, like we do for UTF-16 and UTF-32,
enables use of any of UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 as a statically known
internal encoding, without the implementation defined signedness and aliasing
concerns of <tt>char</tt>, and with protection against accidental interchange
with <tt>char</tt> or <tt>wchar_t</tt> based interfaces without proper
transcoding having been performed first.  Solid support in the type system,
combined with statically known encodings, provides the flexibility needed to
design safe and generic text handling interfaces, including ones that can
support constexpr evaluation.  Why might constexpr evaluation be interesting?
Consider the <tt>std::embed</tt> proposal
(<a title="std::embed"
   href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1040r1.html">
P1040R1</a>
<sup><a title="std::embed"
        href="#ref_p1040r1">
[P1040R1]</a></sup>)
and the ability to process a text file loaded at compile time.
</p>

<p>Distinct code unit types (<tt>char8_t</tt>, <tt>char16_t</tt>,
<tt>char32_t</tt>) enable statically known internal encodings, but not without
some cost.  Existing code that works with UTF-8 today is written using
<tt>char</tt>, <tt>unsigned char</tt>, or <tt>uint8_t</tt>.  Likewise, existing
code that works with UTF-16 today is written using <tt>char16_t</tt>,
<tt>wchar_t</tt>, <tt>unsigned short</tt>, or <tt>uint16_t</tt>.  ICU supports
customization of its internal code unit type, but <tt>char16_t</tt> is used
by default, following ICU's adoption of C++11.  Prior to the switch to C++11,
the default varied by platform.  The switch to <tt>char16_t</tt> created
friction with existing code by, for example, requiring that ICU data passed to
Windows <tt>wchar_t</tt> interfaces be copied or reinterpret cast.  Similar
friction will occur with <tt>char8_t</tt>.  ICU dealt with this by providing
interfaces that, for at least some cases, encapsulate uses of
<tt>reinterpret_cast</tt> and handling of the resulting aliasing issues.
</p>

<p><tt>std::basic_string</tt> isn't a great foundation for working with Unicode
text due to its operations all working at the code unit level as opposed to
code point or grapheme cluster levels.  The <tt>text_view</tt> proposal
(<a title="Text_view: A C++ concepts and range based character encoding and code point enumeration library"
   href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0244r2.html">
P0244R2</a>
<sup><a title="Text_view: A C++ concepts and range based character encoding and code point enumeration library"
        href="#ref_p0244r2">
[P0244R2]</a></sup>)
provides a method for layering encoding aware code point support on top of
<tt>std::basic_string</tt> or any other string like type that provides a range
of code units.  SG16 has been discussing the addition of a <tt>std::text</tt>
family of types that provide similar capabilities, but that also own the
underlying data.  Zach Laine has been prototyping such a type in his Boost.Text
library.
</p>

<p>Introducing new types that potentially compete with <tt>std::string</tt>
and <tt>std::string_view</tt> creates a possible problem for software
composition.  How do components that traffic in <tt>std::string</tt> vs
<tt>std::text</tt> interact?  Discussions in SG16 have identified several
strategies for dealing with this: 1) <tt>std::text</tt> could be convertible
to <tt>std::string_view</tt> and, potentially,
<tt>const std::string &amp;</tt> if it holds an actual <tt>std::string</tt>
object, and 2) <tt>std::text</tt> and <tt>std::string</tt> could allow their
buffers to be transferred back and forth (and potentially to other string
types).
</p>

<p>New text containers and views help to address support for UTF encoding and
decoding, but Unicode provides far more than a large character set and methods
for encoding it.  Unicode algorithms provide support for enumerating grapheme
clusters, word breaks, line breaks, performing language sensitive collation,
handling bidirectional text, case mapping, and more.  Exposing interfaces for
these algorithms is necessary to claim complete Unicode support.  Exposing
these in a generic form that allows their use with the large number of string
types used in practice is necessary to enable their adoption.  Enabling them
to be used with segmented data types (e.g., ropes) is a desirable feature.
</p>


<h1>Directives: Do or do not, there is no try</h1>

<p>Per the general design discussion above, the following directives identify
activities for SG16 to focus on.  Papers exploring and proposing features
within their scope are encouraged.
</p>


<h2>Directive 1: Standardize new encoding aware text container and view types</h2>

<p>This is the topic that SG16 participants have so far spent the most time
discussing, but we do not yet have papers that explore or propose particular
designs.
</p>

<p>We have general consensus on the following design directions:
<ul>
  <li>A new <tt>std::text</tt> type that is an owning string type with a
      statically known character encoding.</li>
  <li>A new <tt>std::text_view</tt> type that is a non-owning string type
      with a statically known character encoding.</li>
  <li>These types will not have the large interface exposed by
      <tt>std::string</tt>.</li>
  <li>These types will encourage processing of code points and grapheme
      clusters while permitting efficient access to code units.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Discussion continues for questions such as:
<ul>
  <li>Should these types be ranges and, if so, should their <tt>value_type</tt>
      reflect code points or extended grapheme clusters?  Or, should these
      types provide access to distinct ranges (e.g., via
      <tt>as_code_points()</tt> and <tt>as_graphemes()</tt> member functions)
      that require the programmer to explicitly choose a level of abstraction
      to work at?</li>
  <li>Can these types satsify the complexity requirements for ranges?  (Ranges
      require O(1) for calls to <tt>begin()</tt> and <tt>end()</tt>, but
      iteration by code point or grapheme cluster may consume an arbitrary
      number of code units due to ill-formed code unit sequences or arbitrary
      numbers of combining code points)</li>
  <li>Should these types be comparable via standard operators?  If so, should
      comparison be Lexicographical (fast, but surprising if text is not
      normalized) or be based on canonical equivalence (slower, but consistent
      results regardless of normalization)?  Should a specialization of
      <tt>std::less</tt> be provided that performs a fast comparison suitable
      for storing these types in containers?</li>
  <li>Should these types enforce well-formed encoded text?  Should validation
      be performed on each mutation?  How should errors be handled?</li>
  <li>Should these types support a single fixed encoding (UTF-8)?  Or should
      multiple encodings be supported as proposed in
      <a title="Text_view: A C++ concepts and range based character encoding and code point enumeration library"
         href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/p0244r2.html">
      P0244R2</a>
      <sup><a title="Text_view: A C++ concepts and range based character encoding and code point enumeration library"
              href="#ref_p0244r2">
      [P0244R2]</a></sup>?
  </li>
  <li>Should these types enforce a normalization form on UTF encoded text?</li>
  <li>Should these types include allocator support?</li>
  <li>Should these types replace use of <tt>std::string</tt> and
      <tt>std::string_view</tt> in most text/string processing code?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>There is much existing practice to consider here.  Historically, most string
classes have either provided code unit access (like <tt>std::string</tt> or
code point access (possibly with means for code unit access as well).  Swift
took the bold move of making extended grapheme clusters the basic element of
Swift strings.  There are many design options and tradeoffs to consider.
Papers exploring the design options are strongly encouraged.
</p>


<h2>Directive 2: Standardize generic interfaces for Unicode algorithms</h2>

<p>SG16 participants have not yet spent much time discussing interfaces to
Unicode algorithms, though Zach Laine has blazed a trail by implementing
support for all of them in his Boost.Text library.  Papers exploring
requirements would be helpful here.  Some questions to explore:
<ul>
  <li>Is it reasonable for these interfaces to be range based over code
      points?  Or are contiguous iterators and ranges over code units needed
      to achieve acceptable performance?</li>
  <li>Can these interfaces accommodate segmented data structures such as
      ropes?</li>
  <li>Many Unicode algorithms require additional context such as the language
      of the text (Russian, German, etc...).  How should this information
      be supplied?  The existing facilities exposed via <tt>std::locale</tt>
      are more oriented towards abstracting operations than providing this
      type of information.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Directive 3: Standarize useful features from other languages</h2>

<p>We've got a start on this with
<a title="Named character escapes"
   href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1097r1.html">
P1097R1</a>
<sup><a title="Named character escapes"
        href="#ref_p1097r1">
[P1097R1]</a></sup>,
but there are no doubt many text handling features in other languages that
would be desirable in C++.  Papers welcome.
</p>


<h2>Directive 4: Improve support for transcoding at program boundaries</h2>

<p>C++ currently includes interfaces for transcoding between the ordinary and
wide execution encodings and between the UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings,
but not between these two sets of encodings.  This poses a challenge for
support of the external/internal encoding model.
</p>

<p>Portably handling command line arguments (that may include file names that
are not well formed for the current locale encoding) and environment variables
(likewise) accurately can be challenging.  The design employed for
<tt>std::filesystem::path</tt> to provide access to native data as well as
access to that data transcoded to various encodings could be applied to solve
portability issues with command line arguments and environment variables.
</p>

<p>An open question is whether transcoding between external and internal
encodings should be performed implicitly (convenient, but hidden costs) or
explicitly (less convenient, but with apparent costs).
</p>


<h2>Directive 5: Propose resolutions for existing issues and wording improvements opportunistically</h2>

<p>While not an SG16 priority, it will sometimes be necessary to resolve
existing issues or improve wording to accommodate new features.  Issues that
pertain to SG16 are currently tracked in our github repo at
<a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues">https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16/issues</a>.

<h1>Non-directives: Thanks, but no thanks</h1>

<p>The C++ standard currently lacks the necessary foundations for obtaining
or displaying Unicode text through human interface devices.  Until that
changes, addressing user input and graphical rendering of text will remain
out of scope for SG16.
</p>


<h2>Non-directive 1: User input</h2>


<h2>Non-directive 2: Fonts, graphical text rendering</h2>


<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>SG16 would not exist if not for early and kind encouragement by Beman Dawes.
</p>

<p>Thank you to all 18 individuals who have attended at least one SG16
teleconference and have thereby contributed to the discussions shaping our
future direction.
